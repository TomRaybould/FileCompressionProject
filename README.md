# Huffman Coding File Compression

This project is an implementation of Huffman Coding.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding

## How to use

1. make
2. ./huffman &lt;File to be compressed&gt;

This will run both the compression and decompression of the file and create the 2 resulting file below:

* compressed.bin = The compressed version of your input file
* decompressed   = The decompressed version of your compressed data(Hopefully looking the same as your original file)
