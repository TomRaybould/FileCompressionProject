# Huffman Coding File Compression

This project is an implementation of Huffman Coding.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding

## How to use

run "make" to compile

### Compression

./huffman -c &lt;File to be compressed&gt; &lt;Destination file&gt;

If no destination is added it will default to "compressed.bin" in your current directory.

### Decompression

./huffman -d &lt;File to be decompressed&gt; &lt;Destination file&gt;

If no destination is added it will default to "decompressed" in your current directory, with no file extention.
